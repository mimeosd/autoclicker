# autoclicker
AutoClicker App for web-based idle games. Or any other idle/clicker game.

One of things I love to do to waste time is playing web based idle / clicker games.
As such games can take a heavy toll on your mouse (and hands), I decided to write this pretty simple clicker app.

Enjoy and have fun!

w - starts clicking
q - stops clicking

Versions change:
0.01 - automated left mouse button clicks

0.02 - added a lot of UI but need to solve some bugs with Entry widgets.
Some options still remain unfinished.
